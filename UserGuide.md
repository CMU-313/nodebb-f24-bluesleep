## Feature Descriptions

### Feature 1: Anonymous Posting
The Anonymous Posting feature allows users to make a post without having their name/profile attached to the post publicly. This feature provides more flexibility for users, giving them the option to post anonymously.

**Key Functionality**:
- **Mark post as anonymous**: When drafting a post, users will see a checkbox that allows them to modify the anonymous status of the post.
- **Post displays as anonymous**: Upon posting, the post shows up without a profile picture or name associated with the post author.

### Feature 2: isAnswered
The `isAnswered` feature helps track the status of topics in the forum, allowing users to identify which topics have received a satisfactory response. It is useful for Q&A or support forums where users focus on unanswered queries.

**Key Functionality**:
- **Mark Topics as Answered**: Users with the necessary privileges can mark a topic as answered.
- **Display Answer Status**: The status (`Answered` or `Unanswered`) is displayed on the topic list view.
- **Restrict Marking Privileges**: The ability to toggle the `isAnswered` status can be restricted to specific users.

### Feature 3: Emoji Reactions
The Emoji Reactions feature lets users express their sentiments on posts by reacting with emojis. This provides a lightweight and intuitive way for users to engage with posts.

**Key Functionality**:
- **React to Posts**: Users can choose from a set of emojis to react to a post.
- **View Reactions**: The total number of reactions and specific emojis used are displayed under each post.
- **Remove Reactions**: Users can remove their reactions if they no longer wish to associate them with a post.

## Implementation Details

### Implementation Details: Feature 1 (Anonymous Posting)
- **Backend Field Handling**: A field `isAnonymous` is added to handle the server requests associated with a postâ€™s anonymity.
  - Relevant Files: `src/posts/summary.js`, `src/topics/create.js`
- **Backend Schema**: The schema was expanded to include the `isAnonymous` field to match the response body of operations.
- **Frontend UI**: A checkbox shows up next to the topic title for users to handle the anonymous state of each post.
- **Integration**: When the checkbox is checked and a post is published, a frontend trigger reflects this change.

### Implementation Details: Feature 2 (isAnswered)
- **Backend Schema**: A new column `isAnswered` was added to the `topics` table in the database to store the status of each topic.
- **API Endpoint (Internal)**:
  - Endpoint: `/post/:pid/answered`
  - Method: `PUT`
  - Body: `{ "isAnswered": true }`
- **Frontend UI**:
  - Checkbox Display: A checkbox is added next to each post. It is checked if the post is answered and unchecked if unanswered.
  - UI Placement: The checkbox is visible both in the main topic list and within the post detail view.

### Implementation Details: Feature 3 (Emoji Reactions)
- **Backend Schema**: No new column was added. Emoji reactions leverage NodeBBâ€™s existing reaction system.
- **API Endpoints**:
  - **Add Reaction**:
    - Endpoint: `/post/:pid/reaction`
    - Method: `PUT`
    - Body: `{ "reaction": "ðŸ˜Š" }`
  - **Remove Reaction**:
    - Endpoint: `/post/:pid/reaction`
    - Method: `DELETE`
    - Body: `{ "reaction": "ðŸ˜Š" }`
- **Frontend UI**:
  - Emoji Picker: Users see an emoji reaction icon next to the post content. Clicking it opens the emoji picker.
  - Displaying Reactions: Selected emojis and counts are displayed below the post content.

## Testing

### Testing: Feature 1 (Anonymous Posting)
- **Front-End Testing**:
  - Verify that the anonymous checkbox is visible in the post creation UI.
  - Ensure the checkbox hides the userâ€™s name and profile picture when posting.
- **Back-End Testing**:
  - Test that the `isAnonymous` field updates correctly in the database.
  - Verify the anonymous status persists across sessions.

### Testing: Feature 2 (isAnswered)
- **Front-End Testing**:
  - Ensure the checkbox toggles between "answered" and "unanswered" states.
  - Verify the status is reflected correctly in both topic list and detail views.
- **Back-End Testing**:
  - Test the API to confirm it updates the `isAnswered` status correctly.
  - Verify that the database saves and retrieves the correct status.

### Testing: Feature 3 (Emoji Reactions)
- **Front-End Testing**:
  - Ensure the emoji picker appears and allows users to react to posts.
  - Test that the reactions display correctly under the post and can be removed.
- **Back-End Testing**:
  - Test the API to confirm reactions are added and removed correctly in the database.
  - Verify that emoji counts update correctly when multiple users react.

## Automated Tests
- The automated tests for these features can be found in the `/tests/` directory. These tests cover both front-end and back-end functionality for the Anonymous Posting, isAnswered, and Emoji Reactions features.
